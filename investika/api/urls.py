"""
This module defines the URL patterns for user-related API endpoints.
The `UserListView` is mapped to the 'users/' URL, which provides a list of all users.
The `RegisterView` is mapped to the 'register/' URL, which handles user registration.
The `UserDetailView` is mapped to 'users/<int:id>/', which provides endpoints 
 for retrieving, updating, and deleting individual users by their ID.
 These paths connect the views to their respective endpoints in the application.
