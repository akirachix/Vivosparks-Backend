"""
This serializer is used to convert User model instances into JSON format and vice versa.
It is based on Django's `ModelSerializer`, which automatically handles the conversion between 
model instances and primitive data types (such as JSON).
The `Meta` class defines the fields that should be included in the serialized output 
 when retrieving or creating a user instance, including sensitive fields like `password`.
